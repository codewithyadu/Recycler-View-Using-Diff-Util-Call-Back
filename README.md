# Recycler-View-Using-Diff-Util-Call-Back
1.This project focused purley on creating recycler view using list adapater and diff util call back.
2.For learning puprose, check how the item state, item state type, view holder and adapter are created seperately.
3.Putting each things seperately, leads to clean code and helps in creating adapter class with less code.
4.Make button visible inside recycler view and perform different opeartions.
5.Check how to add, update and delete element inside recycler view using diff util callback.

Recycler-View-Using-Diff-Util-Call-Back is really one advanced step to avoid heavy usage of notifyDataSetChanged.
DiffUtilCallBack runs on background thread and based on comparison of old and new list, update our recycler view automatically.

Moving forward, it will be wiser to adopt diff util call back for creating recycler view.
